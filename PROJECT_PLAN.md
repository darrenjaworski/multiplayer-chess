### phased development

ðŸŸ¡ means a major phase is in progress

âœ… means an item is completed

- ðŸŸ¡ a local chess match (local)
  - âœ… render a chess board (design, dev)
  - âœ… render pieces on a board
  - âœ… render valid moves on hover
  - âœ… logic for piece movement
    - âœ… basic movement
    - âœ… castling
  - âœ… logic for piece capture
    - âœ… display captured pieces in middle above or below board for player
    - âœ… handle promotion
    - âœ… en pessant capture
  - logic for game states
    - won/lost, stalemate
      - âœ… display game state
      - display game move history
      - display who won
      - display on player line who is in check mate, both in stalemate, etc
      - enable player to forfeit match
    - âœ… undo last move
      - âœ… undo when not your turn
      - âœ… 5 second timer to undo your move and before other player
      - âœ… when capture is undone on board, remove from captured pieces

    - âœ… start screen
    - âœ… two players on same browser window
    - âœ… game modes
      - âœ… unlimited time
      - âœ… presets with 5, 10 or 15 min
        - âœ… clock ticks down on player line
        - âœ… handle time run out
- âœ… show history of moves from game
  - âœ… show all moves listed out for a game
  - âœ… show ticker above game that displays pgn

  - api for websockets
  - frontend client can update via websocket server

  - users can sign up
  - users can search for a match
  - users are paired (matchmaking)
- setup infrastructure and code pipeline
  - applications are built and deployed
- setup domain and deploy
  - DNS

- basic phaser game to render
- answer any questions

30min/1 hour every week for the next 2 months

## session: 9/27

- render the chessboard next time
- setup vscode:

  - gitbash=default terminal
  - setup default git editor
  - lite tutorial on vscode (navigation and tips)

- homework for ian:
