Please practice test driven development when writing code. Run the tests. Write a test that matches our expected changed. Then code the minimum to make the test pass. Run the tests again. If the tests pass then refactor the code that was just implemented.

After each change, run the test and ensure that they pass.

After each change, run the typescript compiler and ensure that it compiles without errors.
